- Reduce downtime to <0.1% annually (99.9% uptime SLA).

## Scope of Work
- UX/UI design and conversion-optimized templates for primary user journeys.
- Accessibility-first development (semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard support).
- Responsive implementation across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- CMS setup (headless or traditional as appropriate), content migration, and editor training.
- Hosting on managed platform with CDN, HTTPS, automated backups, and DDoS protection.
- Analytics setup, event tracking, and A/B testing framework.
- 12 months of managed support and security patching.

## Deliverables

- SLA-backed hosting contract (99.9% uptime), monitoring, and monthly reports.

## Accessibility & Compliance
- Target: WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.
- Deliverables include accessibility testing (automated + manual) and remediation.
- Keyboard navigation, color contrast, screen reader compatibility, and semantic markup will be standard.

## Conversion & Measurement
- Conversion-focused design: clear CTAs, simplified forms, and lead capture flow.
- Implement analytics (GA4 or equivalent), event tracking, funnel reporting.
- A/B testing to optimize headlines, CTAs, and form flows with monthly experimentation cadence.
- KPI targets: conversion rate, bounce rate, average session duration, and page load times.

## Security & Privacy
- TLS everywhere, secure headers, regular vulnerability scanning.
- GDPR/CCPA considerations implemented for forms and tracking; consent management included.
- Role-based access control and audit logging for CMS editors.

## Estimated Cost & Timeline
- One-time implementation: $35,000–$60,000 (design, development, migration, testing).
- Annual hosting & managed service: $8,000–$18,000/year (CDN, backups, support, A/B tools).
- Timeline: 8–12 weeks from kick-off to launch; additional 4–12 weeks for iterative A/B tests and optimization.

## Vendor Requirements
- Proven experience delivering accessible, conversion-optimized websites for B2B/B2C clients.
- Demonstrated uptime and performance history; references required.
- Transparent pricing, clear SLA, and exit strategy for content export.

## ROI Rationale
- Conservative projection: 15% uplift in conversion yields payback within 6–12 months depending on average deal value.
- Reduced maintenance overhead and faster content updates lower operational costs and risk.

## Approval Request
Please authorize procurement to engage a qualified web services vendor within the above budget range and timeline. Upon approval, procurement will shortlist vendors, request proposals, and present recommended vendor for final approval.
