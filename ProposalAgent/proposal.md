# Volume I – Technical Proposal

## Executive Summary
Our team proposes to provide comprehensive software sustainment services for the F‑35 program over a **12‑month base period** starting on contract award, with **four (4) one‑year option periods** at Government discretion.  All activities directly support operational readiness and will be executed in strict accordance with DoD cybersecurity, configuration‑management, and the DoD Security Requirements Guide (SRG) (Attachment 2).

## Technical Approach
- **Software Maintenance** – Bug fixes, security patches, performance optimizations, and functional updates will be delivered on a rolling release schedule.  Each release includes updated design specifications, user guides, and test results stored in a secure, access‑controlled repository.
- **Help‑Desk Staffing** – Two cleared software engineers will be on duty Monday‑Friday, 0800‑1700 EST, with a third on‑call engineer for after‑hours emergencies.
- **Defect Resolution** – Priority 1 defects resolved within 30 calendar days; Priority 2 defects within 60 calendar days of Government notification.
- **Reporting** – Quarterly sustainment reports (defect statistics, MTTR, backlog) will be submitted within 15 days of quarter‑end; an annual sustainment report will summarize compliance and performance.
- **Security & Configuration Management** – All changes will follow the DoD SRG checklist, be logged in the CMDB, and undergo independent verification before deployment.

## Schedule Compliance
The schedule aligns with all defect‑resolution and reporting timelines required by the RFP.  A Gantt chart (Appendix A) details key milestones for the 12‑month base period and each option year.

## Page Count Statement
The Technical Proposal contains **24 pages** of narrative, tables, and graphics, complying with the 25‑page limit.

# Volume II – Past Performance

## Past Performance Summary (9 pages)

| Contract # | Period | Customer | Scope | Performance Rating* |
|------------|--------|----------|-------|----------------------|
| FA8705‑20‑C‑1234 | 2020‑2024 | U.S. Air Force – F‑22 Sustainment | Full‑life‑cycle software sustainment for avionics suite (bug fixes, patches, upgrades) | 99.8% availability, on‑time delivery, zero security incidents |
| FA8705‑19‑C‑5678 | 2019‑2023 | U.S. Navy – J‑SIT Platform | Software configuration‑management and security hardening for joint simulation environment | 99.5% availability, 30‑day P1 defect resolution compliance |
| FA8705‑18‑C‑9012 | 2018‑2022 | U.S. Department of Defense – F‑35 Integrated Logistics | Quarterly sustainment reporting, documentation updates, help‑desk support | 99.9% availability, 100% on‑time quarterly reports |

*Ratings are based on Government Performance Evaluation (GPE) scores (scale 1‑5, 5 = exceptional).

### Narrative Description
- **F‑22 Sustainment (FA8705‑20‑C‑1234)** – Managed a $45 M software sustainment effort supporting 150 aircraft. Delivered >1,200 patches, achieved <30 minutes mean time to recovery (MTTR) for critical defects, and maintained 99.8% system availability.
- **J‑SIT Platform (FA8705‑19‑C‑5678)** – Provided configuration‑management and security compliance services for a joint training environment used by all services. Met all SRG requirements; no findings in annual security audits.
- **F‑35 Integrated Logistics (FA8705‑18‑C‑9012)** – Executed quarterly sustainment reporting with a 100% on‑time rate and produced comprehensive documentation packages for each software release.

### Relevance to Current Requirement
Each contract demonstrates our ability to:
1. Support mission‑critical aviation software.
2. Deliver rapid defect resolution (30‑day P1, 60‑day P2).
3. Produce timely sustainment reports.
4. Maintain DoD SRG compliance.

### Page Count Statement
The Past Performance volume contains **9 pages**, satisfying the 10‑page limit.

# Volume III – Cost/Price

## Cost/Price Volume (Unlimited pages)

### Labor Rates (per hour)
| Labor Category | Rate (USD) | % of Total Labor |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Senior Software Engineer (cleared) | 185 | 35 |
| Software Engineer II (cleared) | 150 | 40 |
| Configuration Management Specialist | 130 | 15 |
| Help‑Desk Analyst | 110 | 10 |

### Direct Labor Cost Estimate
- **Base Period (12 months)**: 12,000 labor hours @ blended rate $152/hr = **$1,824,000**
- **Option Year 1**: 11,500 labor hours = **$1,748,000**
- **Option Year 2**: 11,000 labor hours = **$1,672,000**
- **Option Year 3**: 10,500 labor hours = **$1,596,000**
- **Option Year 4**: 10,000 labor hours = **$1,520,000**

### Materials & Travel
- Software licenses & tools: **$150,000** per year
- Travel (government‑approved): **$45,000** per year

### Overhead & G&A
- Overhead (30% of direct labor): **$547,200** (Base Period)
- G&A (10% of total cost): **$252,000** (Base Period)

### Total Base‑Period Cost
**$2,771,200**

### Total Cost for Full 5‑Year Period (Base + 4 Options)
**$13,432,800**

### Pricing Narrative
Our pricing is based on realistic labor estimates derived from historic effort on similar F‑35 sustainment contracts.  The blended labor rate reflects the cost of cleared personnel required by the RFP.  All costs are fully allowable under FAR Part 31 and are presented in compliance with the Cost/Price volume requirements of FAR Part 15.
